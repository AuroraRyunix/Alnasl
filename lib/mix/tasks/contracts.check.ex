  @moduledoc """
  Fetches every contract listed in `priv/contracts/vendor/contracts.json`
  from its provider, as `mix contracts.sync` would, and compares it with
  the vendored copy byte for byte. Writes nothing. Exits non-zero, with the
  files that were added, removed or changed, when they differ: the provider
  has moved, and Alnasl has to be checked against what it moved to (`mix
  contracts.sync`, then the tests) before it is merely told so in production.

  Needs the network, so it is not part of `mix test`; CI runs it on its own,
  on every push and once a day.
