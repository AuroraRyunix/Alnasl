# notarisation are a separate step (sign_and_notarize.sh) that only runs
# when the certificate exists.

#   Alnasl.app/Contents/Info.plist         rel/macos/Info.plist, filled in
#   Alnasl.app/Contents/MacOS/Alnasl       rel/macos/Launcher.swift, compiled
#   Alnasl.app/Contents/Resources/launcher.sh   rel/macos/launcher.sh
#   Alnasl.app/Contents/Resources/app/     the release, whole
#   Alnasl.app/Contents/Resources/Alnasl.icns   from rel/macos/Alnasl-icon.png
#
# The executable is a small AppKit program (the Dock icon and the window)
# compiled here with swiftc for arm64 and macOS 11; launcher.sh beside the
# release is the part that starts and stops the server. A Swift program on
# macOS 11 and newer links to /usr/lib/swift and the system frameworks
# only, which the check below allows like any other system library.
#
# Checked here, because nothing after this would notice until somebody's Mac
# refused to start the program:
#
#   * the serial library is in the release - an app that cannot open a
#     serial port is a simulator;
#   * every Mach-O file links only to the system (/usr/lib, /System) or to
#     itself. The runner has Homebrew; the arbiter's Mac does not;
#   * the oldest macOS every Mach-O file accepts (`minos`). Any file that
#     wants newer than 11.0 fails the build, by name; otherwise the newest
#     of them goes into LSMinimumSystemVersion and the log.
