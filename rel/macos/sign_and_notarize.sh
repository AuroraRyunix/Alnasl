# Developer ID signing and notarisation for Alnasl.app.
#
#   rel/macos/sign_and_notarize.sh <path to Alnasl.app>
#
# NOT USED YET: there is no Apple Developer account. The workflow runs this
# only when the secrets below exist, and skips it otherwise - the app then
# ships ad-hoc signed by build_app.sh, which macOS opens after the arbiter
# says so once (docs/macos.md). Adding the account is adding these five
# repository secrets; nothing in the workflow changes.
#
#   APPLE_CERTIFICATE_P12_BASE64   the "Developer ID Application" certificate
#                                  and its private key, exported as .p12, base64
#   APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD     the .p12's password
#   APPLE_TEAM_ID                  the ten-character team id
#   APPLE_ID                       the Apple ID that notarises
#   APPLE_APP_PASSWORD             an app-specific password for that Apple ID
#
# What it does: a throwaway keychain with the certificate in it; every
# Mach-O file signed from the inside out with the hardened runtime and the
# BEAM's entitlements (entitlements.plist says which and why); the bundle
# signed last; the bundle sent to Apple's notary service and waited for; the
# ticket stapled to the bundle, so that a Mac with no network at the venue
# still opens it without a question. Then Gatekeeper is asked, here, whether
# it agrees - before anyone downloads it.
