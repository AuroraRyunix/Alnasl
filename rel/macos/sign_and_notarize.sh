# Developer ID signing and notarisation for Alnasl.app.
#
#   rel/macos/sign_and_notarize.sh <path to Alnasl.app>
#
# The workflow runs this only when the secrets below exist (an organisation
# secret in teapot-chess; a fork has none) and skips it otherwise - the app
# then ships ad-hoc signed by build_app.sh, which macOS opens after the arbiter
# says so once (docs/macos.md).
#
#   MACOS_CERT_P12        the "Developer ID Application" certificate and its
#                         private key, exported as .p12, base64
#   MACOS_CERT_PASSWORD   the .p12's password
#   APPLE_TEAM_ID         the ten-character team id
#   ASC_KEY_ID            App Store Connect API key id
#   ASC_ISSUER_ID         App Store Connect API issuer id
#   ASC_KEY_P8            the API key's .p8 file, base64
#
# The notary service is asked with the API key, not with an Apple ID and an
# app-specific password: a key can be revoked without touching an account.
#
# What it does: a throwaway keychain with the certificate in it; every
# Mach-O file signed from the inside out with the hardened runtime and the
# BEAM's entitlements (entitlements.plist says which and why); the bundle
# signed last; the bundle sent to Apple's notary service and waited for; the
# ticket stapled to the bundle, so that a Mac with no network at the venue
# still opens it without a question. Then Gatekeeper is asked, here, whether
# it agrees - before anyone downloads it.
